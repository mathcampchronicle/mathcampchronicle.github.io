Each year, campers learn they can do anything so long as they obey the four rules of mathcamp: be excellent to each other, don’t do stupid things, no fire without staff supervision, and no division by zero without staff supervision. But there used to be a fifth rule, a fifth rule campers were told about each year, but campers since then have forgotten about it. However, no one has ever broken it anyway: the rule was applicable to so little that it just faded away instead. So what was the rule, you may ask. Here is an interview with a former Mathcamper from the 90s that will help to explain it:</p><p>Me: So what was the fifth rule all about?</p><p>Camper: Well, you have to understand, things were a bit different in the 90s. The aliens had visited Mathcamp as recently as ‘97, so the staff thought that the aliens might visit it again. The last time the aliens visited, they had all kinds of weird math to say, having to do with bending twos into ones and vice versa.</p><p>M: Interesting. Were they topologists?</p><p>C: That was the theory, yes. However, they never mistook coffee cups for bagels, so I am not sure this theory has any weight.</p><p>M: Fair. Anyway, could you spell out just what the fifth rule said?</p><p>C: It said ‘Don’t do alien math without staff supervision.’</p><p>M: Concise!</p><p>C: Yes.</p><p>M: I know that at Mathcamp now, the JCs tend to perform skits illustrating how and how not to obey particular rules. What were the skits like for the fifth rule?</p><p>C: Good question. It’s been over twenty years since I saw them myself, but I can remember the general gist. One skit started with an alien landing on Earth, offering to teach some nearby campers about hyperbolic geometry. The correct response, of course, was not to trust the entirety of what the aliens said but to get a staff member to check them.</p><p>M: What exactly would an alien say about hyperbolic geometry anyway?</p><p>C: Well, they might try to convince you that you live in hyperbolic space.</p><p>M: Oh dear.</p><p>C: Exactly.</p><p>M: Well, that’s about all I wanted to ask you. Except I’ve got one more question.</p><p>C: Ok.</p><p>M: Why did the aliens stop visiting Mathcamp?</p><p>C: That’s a good question. I think it actually had to do with the growing awareness of the aliens. Once everyone knew to be wary of them, they stopped showing up.</p><p>M: That makes sense. But how come they haven’t shown up since campers forgot about the fifth rule?</p><p>C: I don’t know, but my theory is that the boogeyman of the alien has been replaced by the boogeyman of the bear. That is, the general wariness of bears means that campers would also be wary of any aliens they encountered. The aliens know that, so they don’t visit.</p><p>M: Well, that wraps up our interview! Thank you for taking the time to do this interview.</p><p>C: You’re welcome!</p><p>So there you have it. Why was there a fifth rule, why was it needed, why hasn’t it been remembered, all answered in this interview.</p><p></p><div class=\"placeholder--teaser-card\"><ld-include data-include-service=\"teaser\" data-include-params=\"{&quot;layout&quot;:&quot;author-embed&quot;}\"></ld-include></div></main><aside class=\"article-content__sidebar\"><div><div class=\"placeholder--free-html\"></div></div><div><h2 class=\"sidebar-title\">Most Popular</h2><div class=\"placeholder--teaser-card\"><ld-include data-include-service=\"teaser\" data-include-params=\"{&quot;layout&quot;:&quot;sidebar-embed&quot;}\"></ld-include></div><div class=\"placeholder--teaser-card\"><ld-include data-include-service=\"teaser\" data-include-params=\"{&quot;layout&quot;:&quot;sidebar-embed&quot;}\"></ld-include></div><div class=\"placeholder--teaser-card\"><ld-include data-include-service=\"teaser\" data-include-params=\"{&quot;layout&quot;:&quot;sidebar-embed&quot;}\"></ld-include></div><div class=\"placeholder--teaser-card\"><ld-include data-include-service=\"teaser\" data-include-params=\"{&quot;layout&quot;:&quot;sidebar-embed&quot;}\"></ld-include></div></div><div><div class=\"placeholder--free-html\"></div></div></aside></div><section class=\"article-content__footer\"><div class=\"container container--halves\"><h2 class=\"container__title\">Recommended Stories</h2><div class=\"container-grid\"><div class=\"container-grid__item\"><div class=\"placeholder--teaser-card\"><ld-include data-include-service=\"teaser\" data-include-params=\"{&quot;layout&quot;:&quot;card&quot;}\"></ld-include></div><div class=\"placeholder--teaser-card\"><ld-include data-include-service=\"teaser\" data-include-params=\"{&quot;layout&quot;:&quot;card&quot;}\"></ld-include></div><div class=\"placeholder--teaser-card\"><ld-include data-include-service=\"teaser\" data-include-params=\"{&quot;layout&quot;:&quot;card&quot;}\"></ld-include></div><div class=\"placeholder--teaser-card\"><ld-include data-include-service=\"teaser\" data-include-params=\"{&quot;layout&quot;:&quot;card&quot;}\"></ld-include></div></div><div class=\"container-grid__item\"><div class=\"placeholder--teaser-card\"><ld-include data-include-service=\"teaser\" data-include-params=\"{&quot;layout&quot;:&quot;card&quot;}\"></ld-include></div><div class=\"placeholder--teaser-card\"><ld-include data-include-service=\"teaser\" data-include-params=\"{&quot;layout&quot;:&quot;card&quot;}\"></ld-include></div><div class=\"placeholder--teaser-card\"><ld-include data-include-service=\"teaser\" data-include-params=\"{&quot;layout&quot;:&quot;card&quot;}\"></ld-include></div><div class=\"placeholder--teaser-card\"><ld-include data-include-service=\"teaser\" data-include-params=\"{&quot;layout&quot;:&quot;card&quot;}\"></ld-include></div></div></div></div></section></article></main><footer class=\"page-foot\" role=\"footer\"></footer></div>","slug":"the-secret-5th-rule-of-mathcamp-77804"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"the-secret-5th-rule-of-mathcamp-77804"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3343468170"]}
